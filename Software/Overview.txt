Boot:
  Power on or Reset switches to address bank 0, which is EPROM, and starts at address 0000

  There resides "Booter"
  "Booter" copies a "monitor" program to common mmory residing at F000, then jumps to that address

  The "monitor" at F000 initializes the memory structures, interrupt table and serial interface chips and the timer chips
  to be ready for serial communications.

  Then it runs the RDK (Rolf-Dieter Klein) monitor I have taken from his book and waits for user Input.

  Bank should now be switched to bank 4, which is RAM.

Further operation:
  User can opt to interact with the monitor: loading/saving from/to cassette, reading/burning EPROM, modify or view memory locations

  Or the user can load the BASIC Interpreter (TDL design labs, free after they have ceased operations).
  BASIC is copied from EPROM (bank 0) via "high memory" (>FF00...) to RAM (bank 4), then started.

Basics:
  In general, everything is interrupt-driven where possible.

  CPU is in HALT mode (the "HALT" LED on the CPU module is typically lit).

  When an input arrives via a SIO (serial interface) chip, the CPU is interrupted and reads the arriving character into a
  memory (ring) buffer. This typically wakes up a "CPM" type interface (character in, character out, wait for character in) interface
  and continues a user program waiting for the input.

  While the user program is running, the "HALT" LED is unlit, until the program again waits for input - the CPU enters "HALT" state
  and the "HALT" LED is lit again.
