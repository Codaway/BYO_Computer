Boot:
  Power on or Reset switches to address bank 0, which is EPROM, and starts at address 0000

  There resides "Booter"
  "Booter" copies a "monitor" program to common Memory residing at F000, then jumps to that address

  The "monitor" at F000 initializes the memory structures, interrupt table and serial interface chips and the timer Chips
  to be ready for serial communications.

  Then it runs the RDK (Rolf-Dieter Klein) monitor I have taken from his book and waits for user Input.

  Bank should now be switched to bank 4, which is RAM.

Further operation:
  User can opt to interact with the monitor: loading/saving from/to cassette, reading/burning EPROM, modify or view Memory Locations

  Or the user can load the BASIC Interpreter (TDL design labs, free after they have ceased operations).
  BASIC is copied from EPROM (bank 0) via "high memory" (>FF00...) to RAM (bank 4), then started.
